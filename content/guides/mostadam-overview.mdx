# Understanding Mostadam

Mostadam is the Saudi Green Building Rating System, tailored specifically to the climate and environmental characteristics of Saudi Arabia. It aligns with Vision 2030 to create a sustainable future.

## Key Categories
1. **Site Sustainability**: Connectivity and ecology.
2. **Transportation**: Reducing carbon footprint from travel.
3. **Regionally Priority**: Water conservation and waste management.

> **Note**: Mostadam is mandatory for certain government projects.

## Comparison with LEED
While LEED is global, Mostadam addresses regional water scarcity and cultural aspects more directly.
