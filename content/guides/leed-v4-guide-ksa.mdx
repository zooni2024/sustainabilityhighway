# LEED v4.1 in KSA

Achieving LEED Gold or Platinum in Saudi Arabia requires a heavy focus on:

- **Cooling Load Reduction**: High performance envelope.
- **Water Efficiency**: Process water recovery.

## Energy Modeling
Use ASHRAE 90.1-2010 baseline generally, but check local code overrides.

> **Tip**: Focus on regional priority credits for easy points.
